SImple_DLL_Injection.py:
DLL injection is a technique that allows a program to execute code within the address space of another process by injecting a dynamic-link library (DLL) into it. 

This code opens a handle to the target process, allocates memory within it for the path to the DLL, writes the path to the allocated memory, gets the address of the LoadLibrary function within kernel32.dll, and creates a remote thread within the target process that calls LoadLibrary with the path to the DLL as its argument. Finally, the handle to the target process is closed.

NTDSAutoCrack.py

In some situations, the NTDS.dit file may be locked and cannot be accessed even through the VSS snapshot. In this case, you can use the SYSTEM registry key to extract the password hashes. Here's an example of how to automate the process of cracking NTDS.dit using VSS and Python with error checking and the option to use the SYSTEM registry key if needed:

This code uses the subprocess module to automate the creation and deletion of a VSS snapshot, as well as the mounting and unmounting of the snapshot. If the attempt to extract password hashes from NTDS.dit using VSS snapshot fails, the script will attempt to extract password hashes using the SYSTEM registry key. The hashcat is used to extract the password hashes from the NTDS.dit file using the VSS snapshot. The rules_path variable specifies the path to a file containing hashcat rules to use during cracking. The output_path variable specifies the path to a file where the cracked passwords will be saved.

If the attempt to extract password hashes from NTDS.dit using VSS snapshot fails, the script attempts to extract password hashes using the SYSTEM registry key. The secretsdump.py script is used to extract the password hashes from the SYSTEM and NTDS.dit files.

After the password hashes have been successfully extracted, the script unmounts the VSS snapshot and deletes it.

Note that this script assumes that hashcat and secretsdump.py are already installed on the system and accessible in the PATH. If they are not, you will need to specify the full paths to the executables.

Also note that this script may require elevated privileges to run, depending on the system configuration.
