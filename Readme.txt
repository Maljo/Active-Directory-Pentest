SImple_DLL_Injection.py:
DLL injection is a technique that allows a program to execute code within the address space of another process by injecting a dynamic-link library (DLL) into it. 

This code opens a handle to the target process, allocates memory within it for the path to the DLL, writes the path to the allocated memory, gets the address of the LoadLibrary function within kernel32.dll, and creates a remote thread within the target process that calls LoadLibrary with the path to the DLL as its argument. Finally, the handle to the target process is closed. 

Note that this example code is for educational purposes only and should not be used for malicious purposes.
