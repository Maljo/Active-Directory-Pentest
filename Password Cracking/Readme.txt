Python script to automate password cracking using multiple wordlists and multiprocessing to make the process faster(if you have multiple different worldists available)

We first define the crack_password function, which takes a single argument wordlist and uses the John the Ripper tool to crack a hashed password using that wordlist.

We then create a list of the wordlists we want to use, and set the number of processes to the length of the list. We use a with block to create a process pool with the specified number of processes, and then use the map function to apply the crack_password function to each wordlist in the list.

The multiprocessing module will automatically distribute the tasks across the available processes, allowing for faster cracking of the password using multiple wordlists.
