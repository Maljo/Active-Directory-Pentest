LDAPRecon.py

This script uses the Python ldap library to connect to an LDAP server, perform a search for objects in the directory, and print the results to the console. To minimize the risk of detection, the script includes a random delay between search requests and targets a specific set of user accounts rather than performing a broad search across the entire directory.
