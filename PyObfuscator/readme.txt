Python script that prompts the user for the name of the input script file, reads the file, obfuscates the variable and function names, and writes the obfuscated script to a new file

This script prompts the user for the name of the input script file using the input() function, reads the file, parses it as an AST using the ast module, obfuscates the variable and function names using the obfuscate_variables() and obfuscate_functions() functions, and then compiles the obfuscated AST back into Python code. The obfuscated code is then written to a new file with the prefix 'obfuscated_' followed by the name of the input file.

Note that this script assumes that the input script file and the output file are in the same directory as the Python script. If they are located in a different directory, you would need to specify the full path to the files.
